# Hospital Admissions & Patient Demographics Dashboard

## Overview

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of hospital admissions and patient demographics for Dayanand Medical College & Hospital (implied from the image). It presents key metrics related to patient characteristics, admission details, lab values, and outcomes. The dashboard aims to facilitate data-driven decision-making and improve operational efficiency by providing insights into patient flow and clinical trends.

## Key Features

* **Patient Demographics:** Displays age and gender distribution, as well as the urban/rural distribution of patients.
* **Admission Details:** Shows the number of admissions over time, admission type breakdown (Emergency vs. OPD), and average stay durations.
* **Lab Values:** Provides key lab values such as glucose, hemoglobin, platelets, total lymphocyte count, urea, and creatinine.
* **Outcomes:** Presents the distribution of patient outcomes (discharge, death, etc.).
* **Interactive Filters:** Allows users to filter data based on admission number, age, gender, outcome, locality, admit type, and month/year.

## Data Sources
